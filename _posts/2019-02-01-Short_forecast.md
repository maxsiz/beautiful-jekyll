For the last two years, we (Iber Blockchain R&D Team) have specialized in developing solutions on the Ethereum platform. In a sense, we have bet on this technology. Therefore, we consider it possible to make a small forecast for 2019.
Everyone knows the blockchain trilemma, which Vitalik Buterin formulated. He said that distributed systems can fully possess only two of the three properties: decentralization, scalability (defined as the ability to process more transactions), and the security.
One class of solutions for increase scalability is the so-called payment channels and state channels. I suppose that in the near future we will see an increase in the number of new and maturation of old solutions (like the Raiden Network). We also plan to participate in this segment of development. Especially in terms of embedding such solutions into existing messengers (Telegram)
