In November 2018, I noticed two publications about Ethereum vulnerabilities in a very respected Internet media. Against the background of a general fall in the crypto market, this news could be perceived by a wide audience as negative towards the Ethereum platform itself.

Therefore, I consider it important to make a small analysis of these two cases.

* Revealed details allowing to empty the wallets of cryptocurrency exchanges vulnerability
